Seco is a powerful command-line security analysis tool designed to identify potential security vulnerabilities in your Python projects. Built with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, it helps developers maintain secure codebases through automated static analysis.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: This project is currently in active development and may contain bugs or incomplete features. While we strive for accuracy, security analysis results should be manually verified. Use in production environments at your own risk.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Static Security Analysis**: Comprehensive scanning for common security vulnerabilities
- **Beautiful CLI Output**: Clear, color-coded terminal output for easy interpretation
- **Flexible Reporting**: Export findings in JSON or HTML formats
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive command-line experience
- **High Performance**: Quick scanning with minimal system resource usage

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package manager

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nixar-1/Seco.git
cd Seco

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Make the script executable (Linux/Mac):
```bash
chmod +x seco.py
```

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Scan
```bash
python seco.py /path/to/your/project
```

### Export Results
```bash
# JSON export
python seco.py /path/to/your/project --output json

# HTML report
python seco.py /path/to/your/project --output html --file report.html
```

### Command-line Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `path` | Directory to scan (required) |
| `--output, -o` | Report format (`json` or `html`) |
| `--file, -f` | Custom output file path |

## ⚙️ How It Works

Seco leverages Bandit, a robust Python security analysis tool, to perform comprehensive static code analysis. It detects various security issues, including:

- 🔒 Hardcoded credentials and secrets
- 💉 SQL injection vulnerabilities
- 🛡️ Command injection vulnerabilities
- ⚠️ Usage of deprecated or insecure functions
- 🔍 Other common security anti-patterns

Results are presented with intuitive severity-based color coding for quick assessment.
