Seco is a powerful command-line security analysis tool designed to identify potential security vulnerabilities in your Python projects. Built with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, it helps developers maintain secure codebases through automated static analysis.

## Project Status ‚ö†Ô∏è

This project is in an active development (alpha) stage and may contain bugs or incomplete features. Security analysis results generated by this tool should be manually verified. Usage in production environments is at the user's own risk.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Static Security Analysis**: Comprehensive scanning for common security vulnerabilities
- **Beautiful CLI Output**: Clear, color-coded terminal output for easy interpretation
- **Flexible Reporting**: Export findings in JSON or HTML formats
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive command-line experience
- **High Performance**: Quick scanning with minimal system resource usage

## üìã Prerequisites

Before installing Seco, ensure you have:
- Python 3.6 or higher (check with `python --version`)
- pip package manager (usually comes with Python)

Project dependencies, including `Bandit` and `Rich`, are listed in `requirements.txt` and will be installed in the next step.

## üîß Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nixar-1/Seco.git
cd Seco
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make the script executable (Linux/Mac):

```bash
chmod +x seco.py
```

## üíª Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Basic scan of current directory
python seco.py .
```

```bash
# Get help
python seco.py --help
```

### Scanning Options

#### Basic Directory Scan

```bash
# Scan specific directory
python seco.py /path/to/directory
```

```bash
# Scan current directory
python seco.py .
```

### Export Results

#### JSON Export

```bash
# Default filename (security_report.json)
python seco.py /path/to/directory --output json
```

```bash
# Custom filename
python seco.py /path/to/directory --output json --file my_custom_report.json
```

#### HTML Report

```bash
# Default filename (security_report.html)
python seco.py /path/to/directory --output html
```

```bash
# Custom filename
python seco.py /path/to/directory --output html --file my_custom_report.html
```

### Command-line Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| path | Directory to scan (required) | python seco.py /path/to/dir |
| --output, -o | Report format (json or html) | --output json |
| --file, -f | Custom output file path | --file report.html |
| --help | Show all available options | python seco.py --help |

### Real-world Examples

Scan a specific project:

```bash
python seco.py /home/user/projects/my_python_app
```

Scan current directory and save HTML report:

```bash
python seco.py . --output html --file security_scan_results.html
```

Generate JSON report for CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
python seco.py . --output json --file pipeline_security_report.json
```

## üìå Future Plans

### Near-term Goals (0-3 months)
- Integration with pip-audit for dependency vulnerability scanning
- Basic automated fixes for common security issues
- Improved reporting format with detailed fix suggestions
- Better handling of false positives

### Mid-term Goals (3-6 months)
- Support for additional programming languages:
  - JavaScript (via ESLint security plugins)
  - TypeScript
  - Java
  - Go
- Integration with Semgrep for advanced pattern matching
- User interface for custom rule creation
- CI/CD pipeline integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)

### Long-term Goals (6+ months)
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension
- Real-time, in-editor security scanning and fix suggestions
- Enhanced custom rule management capabilities
- Interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI)
- Automated vulnerability remediation (e.g., PR generation)
- Machine learning-driven false positive reduction
- Broader integration with security tools and platforms
- Performance optimizations for large codebases

üí° Note: These plans are subject to change based on community feedback and project priorities. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Seco leverages Bandit, a robust Python security analysis tool, to perform comprehensive static code analysis. Seco processes Bandit's findings, focusing on clear and actionable presentation to simplify the application of static analysis for Python developers. It detects various security issues, including:

- üîí Hardcoded credentials and secrets
- üíâ SQL injection vulnerabilities
- üõ°Ô∏è Command injection vulnerabilities
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage of deprecated or insecure functions
- üîç Other common security anti-patterns

Results are then presented with intuitive severity-based color coding and can be exported in user-friendly formats like HTML and JSON, facilitating quick assessment and integration into developer workflows.

## üì¶ Dependencies

Core dependencies include:
- Bandit - Security analysis
- Rich - Terminal formatting
